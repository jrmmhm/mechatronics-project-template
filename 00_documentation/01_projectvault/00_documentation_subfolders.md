## The 3-Question Rule for Every Subfolder
Before creating a subfolder, all three questions must be answered with yes.

1. **Are all files in the folder under the same role?**
    (e.g., exclusively "Component")

2. **Do all files have the same change rate?**
    (e.g., reference data, practically immutable)

3. **Do all files belong to the exact same core object?**
    (not "MCU in general", but specific MCU)
