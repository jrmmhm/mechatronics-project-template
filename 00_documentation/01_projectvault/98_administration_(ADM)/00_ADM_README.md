ADM notes serve project logistics: tasks, planning, open items, status overviews and organizational workflows.
ADM helps to steer the project. It is not technical documentation of the system.


## Goal
- Centrally manage ToDos and open items
- Make progress visible (What is open, what is blocked, what is finished)
- Keep next steps and priorities clear
- Support project organization (deadlines, submissions, procurement, contacts)


## What belongs in ADM
Typical content:
- ToDo lists (brief, prioritized)
- Backlog / idea parking lot
- Weekly plan / sprint plan (if used)
- Risk/blocker list (What prevents progress)
- Purchase/procurement lists
- Contacts, deadlines, submissions (organizational only)
- Checklists for project milestones (e.g. "demo-ready", "submission-ready")
- Status dashboards (e.g. "Top 10 open items")


## Recommended ADM Files (minimal, effective)
- ADM_TODO (central ToDo list)
- ADM_Backlog (ideas / later)
- ADM_Blocker (current standstill + what is missing)
- ADM_Milestones (submissions, demo, review)
- ADM_Procurement (orders, delivery status)
