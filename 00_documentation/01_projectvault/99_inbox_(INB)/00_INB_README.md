## Context
INB is the inbox for unsorted raw notes, quick thoughts, log snippets and intermediate states.
Everything here is temporary.

## Rules
- INB is not permanent storage.
- Each note in INB must either:
  - be sorted within 7 days, or
  - be deleted if it has no lasting value.
- INB notes may be incomplete. That is the purpose of the inbox.

## Prohibited
- Do not leave "finished" documents permanently in INB.
- No permanent double maintenance (INB + target folder).

In short: INB is the entry point. Not the archive.
